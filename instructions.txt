The following is a free response question from 2014. It was question 4 on the exam. You can see all the free response questions from past exams at https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/free-response-questions-by-year.

Question 4. The menu at a lunch counter includes a variety of sandwiches, salads, and drinks. The menu also allows a customer to create a “trio,” which consists of three menu items: a sandwich, a salad, and a drink. The price of the trio is the sum of the two highest-priced menu items in the trio; one item with the lowest price is free. Each menu item has a name and a price. The four types of menu items are represented by the four classes Sandwich, Salad, Drink, and Trio. All four classes implement the following MenuItem interface.

Interfaces are no longer on the AP CSA exam, but you can just treat an interface like a superclass. Just substitute the word class instead of interface below and your TrioClass can extend MenuItem instead of implementing the interface.

The menu allows customers to create Trio menu items, each of which includes a sandwich, a salad, and a drink. The name of the Trio consists of the names of the sandwich, salad, and drink, in that order, each separated by “/” and followed by a space and then “Trio”. The price of the Trio is the sum of the two highest-priced items in the Trio; one item with the lowest price is free. A trio consisting of a cheeseburger, spinach salad, and an orange soda would have the name "Cheeseburger/Spinach Salad/Orange Soda Trio" and a price of $4.00 (the two highest prices are $2.75 and $1.25). Similarly, a trio consisting of a club sandwich, coleslaw, and a cappuccino would have the name "Club Sandwich/Coleslaw/Cappuccino Trio" and a price of $6.25 (the two highest prices are $2.75 and $3.50).
